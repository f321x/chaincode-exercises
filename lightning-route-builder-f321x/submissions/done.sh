# There is NO AUTOGRADER for this assignment. We are only using it to run some basic sanity checks.
# You may only hand in the assignment once, and then it will be manually graded.

# When you are ready to be graded, uncomment the line below to signal that you have completed the assignment.
# This must **only be done** once you have completed the assignment.
