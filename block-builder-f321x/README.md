# Block Builder

Bitcoin miners construct blocks by selecting a set of transactions from their
mempool. Each transaction in the mempool:

- includes a _fee_ which is collected by the miner if that transaction is
  included in a block
- has a _weight_, which indicates the size of the transaction
- may have one or more _parent transactions_ which are also in the mempool

The miner selects an ordered list of transactions which have a combined weight
below the maximum block weight. Transactions with parent transactions in the
mempool may be included in the list, but only if _all_ of their parents appear
_before them_ in the list.

Naturally, the miner would like to include the transactions that maximize the
total fee.

Your task is to write a program which reads a file [`mempool.csv`](mempool.csv),
with the format:

`<txid>,<fee>,<weight>,<parent_txids>`

- `txid` is the transaction identifier
- `fee` is the transaction fee
- `weight` is the transaction weight
- `parent_txids` is a list of the txids of the transactionâ€™s **immediate**
  parent transactions in the mempool. Ancestors that are not immediate parents
  (eg parents of parents) and parent transactions that are already in the chain
  are not included in this list.
  It is of the form: `<txid1>;<txid2>;...`

The output from the program should be txids, separated by newlines, which
make a valid block, maximizing the fee to the miner. Transactions **MUST**
appear in order. No transaction should appear unless its parents are
included, no transaction should appear before its parents, and no
transaction may appear more than once.

We've included a [`block_sample.txt`](block_sample.txt) file to demonstrate the expected format.

## Input file

Here are two lines of the `mempool.csv` file:

```
2e3da8fbc1eaca8ed9b7c2db9e6545d8ccac3c67deadee95db050e41c1eedfc0,452,1620,
```

This is a transaction with txid `2e3da8...`, fees of 452 satoshis, weight of
1620, and no parent transactions in the mempool.

```
9d317fb308fd5451fd0ec612165638cb9e37bd8aa8918dff99a48fe05224276f,350,1400,288ea91bb52d8cb28289f4db0d857356622e39e78f33f26bf6df2bbdd3810fad;b5b993bda3c23bdefe4a1cf75b1f7cbdfe43058f2e4e7e25898f449375bb685c;c1ae3a82e52066b670e43116e7bfbcb6fa0abe16088f920060fa41e09715db7d
```

This is a transaction with txid `9d317f...`, fees of 350 satoshis, weight of
1400 and three parent transactions in the mempool with txids `288ea9....`,
`b5b993...` and `c1ae3a...`

## Submission

Each student will get a private fork of this repository when they accept the
GitHub Classroom assignment. You will commit and push your submissions to GitHub
which will evaluate the answers automatically. You can commit and push as often
as you like.

Your code must read the file [`mempool.csv`](mempool.csv) and write its output
file `block.txt` in the solution directory (`./solution/block.txt`). We expect
that file to be committed in your repo in that location when you submit.
We will also run your code submission to ensure consistency with the output.

You are allowed to write your wallet code in any of the following programming
languages:

- Python
- NodeJS
- C++
- Rust
- Go

**The autograder will not run automatically, you will not see your score on GitHub.
It will run offline, behind the scenes.**

The autograder will run the bash script [solution/run_builder.sh](solution/run_builder.sh) which
MAY BE EDITED BY STUDENTS if you need to install additional dependencies.

The default language for this exercise and the autograder is Python. The easiest
way to complete this project is to complete the obfuscated code template in
[solution/python/builder.py](solution/python/builder.py). No other files need
to be modified unless you want to start from scratch in Python or write in one
of the other languages.

If you choose to write code in something other than Python you MUST modify
[solution/run_builder.sh](solution/run_builder.sh) as well so that your code is compiled and
executed appropriately!

## Hints

- The total weight of transactions in a block must not exceed 4,000,000 weight.
  For this exercise assume that there is no coinbase transaction.
- A transaction may only appear in a block if all of its parents appear
  _earlier_ in the block.
- A transaction must not appear more than once in the block.
- A transaction may have zero, one or many parents in the mempool. It may also
  have zero, one or many children in the mempool.
